## Description

Roll of the Dice is an online dice roller made using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. The user can roll any number of dice with any number of sides. Modifiers and additional dice can be added in the same roll. Results of the individual dice are displayed and tallied for convenience. I designed it with D&D in mind, but it can be used for other dice-based games, or for other dice-rolling purposes.
